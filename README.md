# Spotify-Replica
This project is a responsive replica of the Spotify web interface, designed with a focus on visual similarity and user experience. Built using HTML and CSS, the layout and styling closely mimic the look and feel of the original Spotify platform. The design adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and responsive experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
